## ImageView


</div>

### Description

A picture viewer with thumbnails and afew other options. You can view them in a slide show and you can even set the wallpaper with this. Just take a look. Its not like the usual picture viewer. :) I used a Browse for FOlder module by someone else. So credits goes to him or her for that. No comments but easy to understand and coding is not the best.
 
### More Info
 
Choose directory.

Thumbnails of images in that directory.

Can't view bitmaps..do you have any clue why?
